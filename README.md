## 📌 Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides a **data preprocessing and exploration pipeline** for car price data.  
It loads a pre-cleaned dataset, inspects it, and prepares it for further machine learning modeling.  

The notebook is implemented in **Python** and runs in **Google Colab** or local Jupyter Notebook environments.

## 📂 Workflow

1. **Data Upload**
   - Uses `google.colab.files` to upload the dataset (`cleaned_data.csv`).

2. **Data Loading**
   - Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame using `pd.read_csv()`.

3. **Data Inspection**
   - Display the first few rows (`df.head()`).
   - Check for missing values and general dataset structure.

4. **Data Preparation**
   - At this stage, the dataset is ready for further **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** or **machine learning models**.
